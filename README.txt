Evan Frawley Avvo SetGame Submission

Design Choices:
I decided to go with 3 files, the Card object, a SetManager object, and a SetClient program.
The goal was that the user would be able to choose which functionality tha they wanted to test
so that I used an elementary interactive loop to allow the user to choose what they want to do.



WishList:

If I had more time to work on this project, I would implement a few more functionalities and touch
the code up as well. Firstly, I can be a pretty competitive person when I am playing games, and
understanding game theory as well as optimal decision making processes really gets my heart racing.
Because of this, I would want to implement some check or some functionality that would remove the
set from the board state that minimizes the number of possible sets that can be created. Allow me to
elaborate. If I remove a set from the board state that minimizes other set from being created, and
given that I took that one set from the board state, I would have a higher chance of winning because
the other players would have less chances of completing more sets. (I hope that made sense!)

If I had more time, I would implement a bunch of other exception checks and check to protect the
files from adversarial users. I sort of just threw this code together with the intention that the
code would only be used with the supplementary code that I created as well. If it were to be expanded,
I would make the code more robust and take in other variables / factors if Set were to release an expansion.

Lastly, I would like to maximize runtime and space efficiency, so if I had more time, I would make
this code run better / faster / more efficiently.
